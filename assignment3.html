            <p>What was the issue?
                The score only shows once and never again â€” even if you press A
            </p>
            <p>How did you solve it? At the beginning of the code, you need to define the variable score and initialise it to 0. When the button A is pressed, the value of the score should be increased and the new score should be displayed at the same time.</p>

            <h2>Task 2</h2>
            <p>What was the issue? The original code only considers the situation of turning on the flashlight when the light dims, and does not deal with the situation when the light dims.</p>
            <p>How did you solve it? By adding else blocks, we have completed the processing logic when the light is bright to ensure that the flashlight can be turned off correctly when the room is bright.</p>

            <h2>Task 3</h2>
            <p>What was the issue? The secret variable is assigned to 0 in advance and is outside the input.onButtonPressed function. </p>
            <p>How did you solve it? The assignment of the secret variable is placed inside the input.onButtonPressed function, and a new random number is regenerated every time the button A is pressed</p>
